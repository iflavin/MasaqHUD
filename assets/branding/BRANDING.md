# MasaqHUD Branding

This document defines the branding and visual identity rules for the MasaqHUD project.

Branding exists to prevent confusion, protect users, and ensure that derivative works do not misrepresent their relationship to the original project. It is not intended to restrict legitimate forks or experimentation.

---

## Project Name

The canonical project name is **MasaqHUD**.

### Usage rules
- Always spell the name as `MasaqHUD`
- Do not alter capitalization
- Do not abbreviate the name (for example: `MHUD`, `Masaq`, etc.)

Forks or derivative projects must not use the name **MasaqHUD** in a way that implies official status, endorsement, or continuity unless explicitly granted.

---

## Official Logo

The official MasaqHUD logo is located at:

```
assets/branding/masaqhud-logo.png
```

This image represents the current visual identity of the project.

### Logo intent
- Depicts a monitoring overlay / HUD
- Black and white, high contrast
- Minimalist, technical, non-decorative
- Includes a subtle ring-world motif as an easter egg

The logo may evolve over time. This file is considered the canonical reference for the current release.

---

## Logo Usage

The logo **may be used**:
- In documentation referencing MasaqHUD
- In screenshots or articles discussing the project
- In forks **only if** it does not imply official endorsement

The logo **must not be used**:
- To imply that a fork or derivative work is the official MasaqHUD project
- As part of a commercial product name without permission
- In a misleading or deceptive context

When in doubt, remove or replace the logo in derivative works.

---

## Source Code vs Branding

The MasaqHUD source code is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**.

Branding assets—including:
- the project name
- logo
- visual identity

are **not automatically licensed under Apache 2.0**.

The license governs the code. Branding is governed by this document.

---

## Forks and Derivative Projects

Forks are encouraged.

If you significantly modify behavior, architecture, or scope:
- Rename your project
- Replace the logo
- Avoid language that implies official status

This helps users clearly understand what they are running.

---

## Visual Style Guidelines

These are guidelines, not strict rules.

- Prefer monochrome or low-color designs
- Avoid gradients and decorative effects
- Favor clarity over ornamentation
- Maintain a technical, restrained aesthetic

MasaqHUD is a utility, not a brand statement.

---

## Future Branding Changes

Branding may evolve as the project matures.

Changes will be:
- Deliberate
- Documented
- Backwards-compatible where reasonable

No guarantee is made that branding assets will remain unchanged across major releases.

---

## Questions or Permissions

If you need clarification or permission regarding branding usage, open an issue in the repository for discussion.

---

### Summary

- Code is open and permissive
- Branding is intentionally controlled
- Forks are welcome, impersonation is not
